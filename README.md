## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

I have imrpoved on using margin and padding properities effectifely. Building a responsive tex-size without using media queries was a bit challenging. So i have done some research, and found the calc() function on CSS. I took some time trying different configurations to find the best values that suited my project. 

The code i used is below;

font-size: calc(0.6rem + 0.5vmin);

I have learned that to make responsive text-sizing i should not use 'px' values. Instead using 'rem' and 'em' values makes it more adaptive and responsive for various devices. 

### Continued development

Getting used to designing and using Semantic HTML feels satisfiyng. I want to improve as much as i can to write cleaner and more adaptive code.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19917578/text-automatically-resizes-without-media-queries-responsive-design) - This helped me for adaptive text-sizing solution.
- [Example resource 2](https://dev.to/vulcanwm/responsive-text-without-media-queries-4enc) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand text-sizing. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
